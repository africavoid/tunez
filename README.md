# TUNEZ
This is a personal project to create a console music player.
Right now the ui is non functional, infact most of the program is non functional.
I will be working on this in my own time and I suggest you turn away now if you find this.
You will need SDL2 to compile and run this program as I am using SDL to play the audio.
I have made all this on a FreeBSD system so you should be able to get it to work anywhere, apart from Windows.

# What works
Right now there is a primitive system to play mp3s and a somewhat functioning way to play and control,
wav files. A lot of work needs to be done to make this better and I will be working on this until it's great.

# TODO
Lessen the dependance on audio.h and move fully over to SDL.
Clean up the code as it's pretty messy.
Improve the mp3 controls and the wav controls
