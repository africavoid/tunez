# TUNEZ
This is a personal project to create a console music player.
Right now the ui is non functional, infact most of the program is non functional.
I will be working on this in my own time and I suggest you turn away now if you find this.
Although if you want a .wav player, I geuss you could build and run wavplay as it works.

# What works
Right now as of this commit you can play music using the -p flag 'mex -p music/tangospellbound.wav' 
There is a somewhat ui where you can pause/unpause the music and quit the program
